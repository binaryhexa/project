          <p>Hey, it's Giffar.
            <br>
            I'm sorry if i couldn't say this to you personaly, don't know how to say this properly tho *sigh.
            Just make sure you keep this between us, nobody can know this secret.
            I've actually have a crush on you since the first semester. I know, crazy to think
            that i've been silence for years. i'm so truly sorry if after this our friendship is ruined because i wrote 
            this kind of "letter". I just wanted you to know that you're just beautiful as always and it never change
            since the day i first saw you. 
            I don't know how you do it, but everytime i see you, every single time,
            you've always have that positive energy you carrying that somehow, it makes me happy, feel comfort in so many ways.
            It is bothering me sometimes, the feelings i have, i just wan't to protect you from everything.
            feels like my fault if you're not doing okay. It's like i wanna be there for you but i can't. Who am i?
            I wanna be your place to share a stories, to keep each others safe, to look out for each others.
            Last thing before you close this message: Keep being you, you deserve to be happy.
            It's actually enough for me to know that you're happy. If you needed someone to talk, just remember
            i will always be there for you.
            <br>
            <br>
            <!-- P.S. If you have some time, can we talk? Let me know!:) -->
          </p>
